    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This spicy, rich, delicious pasta dish is made with tomatoes and gochujang. Gochujang is a Korean red chili paste commonly used in stir-fries and sauces. 
        By carmelizing tomato paste and gochujang together it brings out a savory, layered heat that becomes a flavorful base for foundational pasta sauce 
        ingredients: chicken broth, heavy cream, and Parmesean. The unexpected Korean twist on this pasta dish will have you asking for seconds.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pint cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup tomato paste</li>
        <li>2-3 tablespoons gochujang (Korean red chili paste), depending on your spice preference</li>
        <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>3/4 cup chicken broth (not low-sodium)</li>
        <li>1/2 to 3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesean cheese, depending on how much cheese you like</li>
        <li>Honey (optional)</li>
        <li>8 ounces dry rigatoni, or pasta shape of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Arrange the cherry tomatoes on a foil-lined baking sheet. Drizzle the tomatoes with the oil and season with salt and 
            pepper. Roast the tomatoes for 20-25 minutes, until they soften and begin to burst.</li>
        <li>While the tomatoes are roasting, prepare the sauce. In a large saucepan melt the butter over medium heat and add the minced garlic. Cook for 1 minute, 
            stirring frequently, until fragrant. Add the tomato paste and gochujang to the pan. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook the mixture for 3-5 minutes, 
            stirring freguently, until the tomato paste and gochujang caramelize.</li>
        <li>Add the heavy cream and chicken broth and bring the sauce to a simmer. Continue simmering, stirring frequently, until the sauce begins to thicken an the 
            tomato paste and gochujang are fully disolved, 3-4 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir in the Parmesean and several cranks of freshly ground 
            black pepper. Season the sauce with salt to taste and a couple drizzles of honey, if desired.</li>
        <li>Continue to reduce the sauce until it thickens, about 5 minutes, then gently stir in the roasted tomatoes.</li> 
        <li>In a pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta according to package instructions. When the pasta is almost finished cooking, you can add a splash of pasta 
            water to the sauce if a thinner sauce is desired.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta, then toss it in the warm sauce and serve immediately with a few more cranks of black pepper.</li>   
    </ol>
