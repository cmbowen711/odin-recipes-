    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For a quick dinner, whip up this authentic Spaghetti Carbonara recipe, a rich tangle of pasta, bacon and egg. 
        This pasta dish with Roman origins is sure to win, calling for just 5 ingredients (not including salt and pepper) 
        and done from start to finish in 20 minutes. When made properly, the eggs in carbonara should melt with the starchy 
        water and cheese to create a creamy, silky, luxurious sauce all on their own. Then when combined with chewy  al 
        dente pasta, lots of bacon and a generous crack of black pepper, it creates the ultimate comfort food.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs and 2 large yolks, room temperature</li>
        <li>2 ounces grated Parmesean cheese</li>
        <li>Coarsely ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>3 1/2 ounces of bacon, sliced into pieces about 1/4 inch thick</li>
        <li>12 ounces spaghetti</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a large pot of lightly salted water over high heat, and bring to a boil. Fill a large bowl with hot water 
            for serving, and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, yolks and Parmesean. Season with a pinch of salt and generous black pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat, add the bacon, and saute until the fat just renders, on the edge of 
            cripness but not hard. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add pasta to the water and boil until a bit firmer than al dente. Just before pasta is ready, reheat bacon in skillet, 
            if needed. Reserve 1 cup pasta water, then drain pasta and add to skillet over low heat. Stir for a minute or so.</li>
        <li>Empty serving bowl of hot water. Dry it and add hot pasta mixture. Stir in cheese mixture, adding some reserved pasta water 
            if needed for creaminess. Serve immediately, dressing it with a bit of additional grated Parmesan and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
